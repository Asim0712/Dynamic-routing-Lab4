# React + Vite+ Router 

# Dynamic Routing


## Scenario
You are tasked with building a small but feature-rich blog application. This will require you to implement a core feature of modern web applications: dynamic routing. You’ll create a system where a list of blog posts links to individual, dynamically generated pages for each post.

Furthermore, you will implement a basic authentication system and create a “protected” admin area that is only accessible to logged-in users, a common requirement in real-world applications.

This lab will give you hands-on experience with React Router and handling URL parameters.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Learning Objectives
- Upon successful completion of this lab, you will be able to:

- Implement dynamic routes in React Router to generate pages from data.
- Create a main “index” page that links to multiple dynamic detail pages.
- Read and use route parameters (slugs or IDs) to fetch and display data for a specific page.
- Structure a basic client-side authentication system using React Context.
- Create a protected route that redirects unauthenticated users.
- Conditionally render UI elements based on the user’s authentication status.
- (Bonus) Implement simple animated page transitions.
